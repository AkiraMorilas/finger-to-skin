# finger-to-skin
Takes skin elements, and arranges them per-finger in an osumania skin.
The supported keycounts are all sensible *keyboard* keycounts, so
- 1K to 10K
- 13K in 3K7K3K arrangement(which cannot have keybinds changed, but can actually be mapped wit notepad editing)
- 17K in 4K9K4K arrangement(same as above)
- 18K in 4K10K4K arrangement

This script doesn't generate anything for controller keycounts like 10K2S, mainly because I don't play controller games like BMS anymore, but also because scratching support is buggy in stable and non-existent in lazer(which is what I play).

# TODO:
- soundsphere support
- togglable advanced mode where you choose every image(right now same image is used for note, LN head, LN body and LN tail)
- support for key images
- autogenerating other parts of skin.ini like column lines
