# finger-to-skin
Takes skin elements, and arranges them per-finger, and generates an osumania skin.
The supported keycounts are all sensible **keyboard** keycounts, so
- 1K to 10K
- 13K in 3K7K3K arrangement(which cannot have keybinds changed, but can actually be mapped with notepad editing)
- 17K in 4K9K4K arrangement(same as above)
- 18K in 4K10K4K arrangement

This script doesn't generate anything for controller-oriented keycounts like 12K(10K2S), mainly because I don't play controller games like BMS anymore, but also because scratching support is buggy in stable and non-existent in lazer(which I use).

# TODO:
- center playfield(depends on me finding a mania skinning guide that HASN'T been replaced years ago by a link to the skinship circlejerk website that has ZERO information about mania skinning)
- figure out LightPosition, BarlineHeight, JudgementLine and NoteBodyStyle
- key images
- soundsphere support
- togglable advanced mode where you choose every image(right now same image is used for note, LN head, LN body and LN tail)
- eventually just generating the whole skin.ini
